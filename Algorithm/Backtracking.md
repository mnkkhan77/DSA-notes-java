backtracking is just optimized recursion meaning when in recursion the condition starts failing we just stop going further in that path and backtrack and try another route

## Types of Backtracking Problems
- **Decision Problems**: search for a feasible solution.
- **Optimization Problems**: search for the best solution.
- **Enumeration Problems**: find set of all possible feasible solutions.

## Applications of Backtracking
- Creating smart bots to play Board Games such as Chess.
- Solving mazes and puzzles such as N-Queen problem.
- Network Routing and Congestion Control.
- Decryption
- Text Justification
